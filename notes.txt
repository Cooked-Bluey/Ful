Notes:
The air here is so heavy, it stinks of iron and death.
i can't place my finger on it but the walls here feel like they're listening
hopefully we can find some fuel to get out of here
it feels like walking through an old grave yard

A warning to any who find this
leave in any capacity that you can
this place will subject you to things worse than death
i've forgot what humanity even means cause of this place 

I don't believe it 
this can't be real
we thought it was a person
but something was very wrong with them
there was no soul
only purpose 
who could stomach creating such an abomination

Data Logs:
Log 01 - ID Captain, Mr Xavier:
    we have reached stable orbit, solar panels are fully deployed and all glucose replicators are operational 
    they still won't tell us why we are here or what for.
    I've flown hundred of mining facilities out to their dig sites, and even more researchers to the next "universe defining outpost"
    but this feels different, the suits said it should be no different but I don't like it.
    The researchers seem closer to cult members than anything.

Log 37 - ID Medical Officer, Dr Martin:
    It's been a month onboard the Fulcrum and it seems that no one knows what is really happening,
    but there is a rumor that we are here on some top secret mission to help with the food shortage on titan, 
    my question is: why have us do it at such an isolated location, 
    another thing is that they keep getting me to look at tissue sample, 
    i understand that lab grown meat is a possibility but that doesn't explain the adrenal glands
    i found within the supposedly lab grown pieces.

Log 17 - ID Power Grid Engineer, Miss Lamarr:
    It makes 0 sense, why would we need so much power, this is a researchers facility for useless rocks,
    so why am I managing enough power to light up new california republic for a year.
    There has to be a reason, a shame that we're strictly forbids from asking about it,
    i'm starting to understand why so many had passed up on this job.
